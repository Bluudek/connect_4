  <h1>Connect 4</h1>
  <h2>A classic and "easy" game, known by almost every human alive.</h2>
  
**The rule is pretty straightforward** - you have to put (at least) 4 tokens in a row, either horizontally, vertically or diagonally.  
Only difference is that here you can have more fun by choosing different sized grids to play on, as well as colors.  
*There's also a plan to extend this game with more modes, such as "player vs bot" and "online multiplayer".*

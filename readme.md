# CONNECT-4 (webapp mini-project)
### A webapp version of the "CONNECT 4" game.
*It was not built for client-server stucture (for now),*
but it was mostly built for fun, and a bit for a training.

~~It is one of the biggest things I did (I was sitting there scratching my head and begging for it to work)~~

I put some comments here and there, so you can read my mess and understand what I wrote (nah jk, it's not that bad).

Project doesn't support light mode. ~~Light mode is for loosers.~~
But being serious - I'll do it sometime.

<sub>It doesn't even have a favicon lol.</sub>

### And also
That's only a PvP game, because I need to take some more time for the "AI" thing.
It's not a big, serious project. Only one of the few I have commited here.


### SO
If you have any questions about it or you want to contribute, go ahead.
(btw I'm not that familiar with how GitHub works, but I'll try to work with it in some way).

# CONNECT-4 (mini-project)
### A webapp version of the "CONNECT 4" game.
*It was not built for client-server stucture (for now),*
but it was mostly built for fun, and a bit for a training.

### And also
That's only a PvP game, because I need to take some more time for the "AI" thing.

### SO
If you have any questions about it or you want to contribute, go ahead.
(btw I'm not that familiar with how GitHub works, but I'll try to work with it in some way).

## Here you got some screenshots of this mini-project
